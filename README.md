# Udacity Would You Rather Project

## Project Overview

```
In "Would You Rather?" Project, I built a web app that lets a user play the "Would You Rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

 Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven't answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see users' ranking on the leaderboard.

```
